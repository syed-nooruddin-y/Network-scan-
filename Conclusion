The Nmap scan of the network was successfully completed and provided a clear overview of the devices and services active within the environment. During the scan, multiple hosts were detected, each running different services and exposing various ports. By analyzing these results, I gained insights into how network devices communicate and which services are commonly active in a typical network setup.
Several open ports were identified across different devices, including SMB, SSH, DNS, HTTP, and ADB. These services are useful for legitimate operations, but they can also introduce security risks if not properly configured, secured, or updated. For example, SMB ports (139/445) are known targets for malware and exploits such as EternalBlue, while SSH (22) may be vulnerable to brute-force login attempts if strong authentication is not enforced. Similarly, the ADB service (5555), often seen on Android-based devices, can allow unauthorized full-device access when exposed.
Completing this task helped me build a practical understanding of how reconnaissance works in real-world cybersecurity. I learned how to identify exposed network services, analyze open ports, and assess the potential attack surface of a network. Using tools like Nmap for scanning and Wireshark for packet analysis provided valuable hands-on experience with industry-standard security techniques.
Overall, this task not only strengthened my foundational skills in network scanning and security assessment but also improved my ability to interpret scan results and recognize potential vulnerabilities. It was a valuable and informative exercise that deepened my practical knowledge of network security.
