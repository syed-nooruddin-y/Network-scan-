## Future Improvements

- Perform deeper vulnerability scanning using Nmap scripts (Nmap NSE).
- Automate daily scans with a Bash script for better network monitoring.
- Use tools like Nikto or OpenVAS to expand vulnerability assessment.
- Document each scan with timestamps and compare changes over time.
- Explore firewall hardening and port restriction techniques to improve network security.
