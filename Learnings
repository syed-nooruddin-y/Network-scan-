## Key Learnings

- Gained hands-on experience with active and passive network reconnaissance.
- Learned how different Nmap flags (-sS, -sV, -T4, --min-rate) affect scan speed and accuracy.
- Understood how to identify active hosts, open ports, and running services on a network.
- Improved my ability to analyze Nmap outputs and differentiate between normal and risky services.
- Understood the importance of minimizing exposed services to reduce the attack surface.
- Realized how misconfigured or outdated services can lead to real-world vulnerabilities.
